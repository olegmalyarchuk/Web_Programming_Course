                <b>Fairy</b>
                    Over hill, over dale,
                    Thorough bush, thorough brier,
                    Over park, over pale,
                    Thorough flood, thorough fire,
                    I do wander everywhere,
                    Swifter than the moon's sphere;
                    And I serve the fairy queen,
                    To dew her orbs upon the green.
                    The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
                    In their gold coats spots you see;
                    Those be rubies, fairy favours,
                    In those freckles live their savours:
                    I must go seek some dewdrops here
                    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
                    Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
                    Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
                <b>PUCK</b>
                    The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
                    Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
                    For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
                    Because that she as her attendant hath
                    A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
                    She never had so sweet a changeling;
                    And jealous Oberon would have the child
                    Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
                    But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
                    Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
                    And now they never meet in grove or green,
                    By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
                    But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
                    Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
